from simple files to full stack app

You'll want to pick a name and repo so you can have the format

`github.com/<username>/<name>`

- [01 - start using `hof gen`](./01/)
- [02 - scaffold with data + templates](./02/)
- [03 - generate a full-stack app](./03/)
- [04 - create a reusable module](./04/)

We will use this module to build another
[full-stack app](../full-stack-app/)
in the next demo.

(dev, multi-token generator names should work. Do they now?)
